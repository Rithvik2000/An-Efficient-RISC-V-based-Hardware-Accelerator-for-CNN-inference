# An-Efficient-RISC-V-based-Hardware-Accelerator-for-CNN-inference
An efficient hardware accelerator integrated with a RISC-V processor for CNN inference applications on low power edge platforms. The hardware accelerator can be accessed via a custom instruction set. This accelerator achieved an improvement in throughput and energy efficiency by reducing data movement from external memory.
